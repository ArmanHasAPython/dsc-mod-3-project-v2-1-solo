The task involved producing a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. This was a binary classification problem.

The target audience was the telecom business itself, SyriaTel and it was of high interest to find the customers the organisation was losing money on as they don't stick around very long. 

Notice if there were any predictable patterns 

Predicting customer churn using SyriaTel's telecommunication data set and enlisting a large group of variables taken into consideration.
